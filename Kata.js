//Remove First and Last Character
/*It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.*/

///Solution///
/*function removeChar(str) {
  return str.slice(1, -1);
}*/
